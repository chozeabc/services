                <h2> How Does Eko Work? </h2>
                        
                        <p> Through the app, users will have the option to create a new account or log in to their existing account. Primarily, users will see individuals/groups/organizations that they are following in the Activity section of the app.  </p>
                        <p>Alongside activities, Eko will display sustainability actions that are trending through an Explore button and this will help users discover other individuals/groups/organizations that are making a positive impact to the environment as well as giving a sense of motivation to complete an eco-friendly task. If a user likes/supports a post they see on the app, they have the option to re-share on their feed. On the upper right corner of the app, users have the option to create a post portraying an eco-friendly task they performed.</p>
                        <p>Next to activities, there will be a Task button which displays a variety of available weekly environmental tasks an individual can do. </p>    

                <h2>
                    <br>
                    What type of task are in the app?
                </h2>
                <br>

        
                <p>
                    1. Daily Life Tasks: <br>
                        Ex: Using reusable bags, recycling plastics, etc
                    
                    <br> 2. Actively participate in environmental activities:
                        Eko will display group events offered around a user's community.
                    <br>
                        Ex: picking up trash in parks and beaches, grow a community 
                        garden, joining a walk-a-thon, etc. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside participating in eco-friendly tasks, users have the opportunity to create a new task that others can participate in. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    
                            Users will have to choose which category the task will fall under [Daily Life Task or Actively Engaged Task]
                
                        
                            Once selected, users will see text stating: Task Name and Description. This is where users will write the name of the task and the purpose/main idea/objective of the task

                        
                            Once written, users will select a date and time (the duration of when other users can begin the task and when it will end)
                    
                        
                            Users then select who can participate in the task. (Is it a team based or individual based task?)

                        
                            Users will see a review page displaying all of the choices they made for the task and if all is correct, they can press Create Task
                
                    
                            Underneath the same Task button, users will see the progress they made after performing the tasks and how much money they save.

                    
                            After earning a significant amount of points/savings, users will earn rewards such as cash back or gift cards they can use at stores.
                    
                            Lastly, users can have access to make changes to their profile by pressing the Profile button.
